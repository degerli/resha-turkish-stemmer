resha-turkish-stemmer
=====================

A fast and less aggresive stemmer for Turkish in Java

A dictionary (generated by Nuve) based stemmer for Turkish.

####Key Features
- Singleton, thread safe, lazy initialized
- Dictionary contains more than 1.1 million word-stem pairs.
- Less aggresive and more accurate than the Turkish stemmer in SnowBall

In Turkish words are composed of three parts. Root, derivational suffix(es), inflectional suffix(ex).

Example:

aboneliðimi => abone (root) + lik (der.sfx) + im (inf. sfx) + i (inf. sfx)
abonelik (stemmed)

Pay attention to the derivational suffix "lik" which becomes "lið" if a suffix starting with a wovel comes after it. A stemmer must both detect the inflectional suffixes and convert "lið" to "lik" after removing the inf. suffixes.

Nuve is an NLP library that can perform such complex morpholgic analysis (and more) which is required for many tasks like stemming. This complex analysis could be expensive for applications in which there are millions of words to be stemmed.

NuveJStemmer is a Turkish stemmer based on a dictionary which consists of already stemmed words by Nüve. The dictionary includes more than 1.1 million word-stem pairs.
